Project 1:  Title: Modeling loan application prediction and default risk assessment: An Integrated Machine Learning Approach.

1. Aim: To develop a machine learning model that effectively predicts loan application outcomes and assesses default risks for approved clients.
2. Objective: To enhance the efficiency of the lending process for consumers while highlighting the possible risk of default.
3. The model's success will be measured by assessing how accurate the model is in predicting loan approvals and the probability of a client defaulting by comparing the model's predictions with the actual outcomes. A generalization test will be done by evaluating its performance on unseen data and confusion matrix analysis that will aid in understanding the prediction errors the model makes.

This project uses two seperate datasets the loan approval dataset and the data countaining customers who have defaulted on their loans, the EDA is done on both and to compare manually trained models the author also performed data analysis using the pycaret library that automates key steps in the machine learning workflow.

Project 2: RFM Customer segmentation

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) customer segmentation analysis aims to categorize customers based on their purchasing behaviour to identify high-value, at-risk, and low-engagement segments. The primary objectives are to 
1. enhance customer retention 
2. optimize marketing strategies 
3. improve profitability 
Target each segment with tailored promotions, loyalty programs, or re-engagement campaigns. By analyzing how recently (Recency), how often (Frequency), and how much (Monetary) customers spend, businesses can prioritize resources effectively, boost customer lifetime value, and drive data-driven decision-making.


Project 3: Sentiment analysis on the use of Ebikes using Redit and Youtube APIs

The task was to collect data started with compiling a list of keywords that will be used to get search results from Google as well as the two chosen social media platforms Reddit and YouTube. To understand the landscape surrounding electric bicycles and to obtain more information that can help solve the tasks at hand the first place the author searched was done on the google search engine. The author combined comments collected from both platforms and analysed how users as well as non-users feel about electric bikes.
